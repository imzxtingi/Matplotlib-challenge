Module 5 - Data Visualization

I looked at a lot of documentation from Pandas and Matplotlib to figure out syntax and documentation for different lines of code.  I looked up how to do an aggregation method for the summary statistics so that I can only write one line of code.  I also found the pandas.index.values line through the Pandas Documentation website so that I could correctly plot the xticks.  I also had to look up through MatplotLib Documentation and also StackOverflow on how to correctly format the box and whiskers plot (flierprops line of code).  I also found the pandas.DataFrame.drop.duplicates line of code from the Pandas Documentation website.
